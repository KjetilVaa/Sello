# Sello

Sello is an Android and iOS app for selling and buying used books. It fetches your location and profile (via Facebook API) and finds books for sale within a self choosen radius. After you find a seller/buyer you get connect via a chat to conclude your business! I made this on my spare time, on the side of my studies in computer science (2nd year).

## Motivation
This app was originally ment for students (on campus), since I thought new school books were (and still are) extremely expensive. Nevertheless, it will work for every type of books and could easily be extended to include different products.
## Technology
It has never been easier to make an mobile application compatible on several platforms.
In summary, I used:
1. React Native
2. Redux
3. Expo
4. Firebase
5. Facebook API
5. Small 3rd party libaries and native libaries to collect data (see package.json)
## Architecutre
Firebase backend to handle

- Auth system
- Real-time response

And React native frontend.
